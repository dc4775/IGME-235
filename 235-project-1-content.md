# Game name: Easy Money

## Height Concept: It is Agar.io meets Gold Miner! 

## Genre: Strategy

## Platfrom:
It will be mobile-friendly, and works on desktop as well. 

## Story:
This is a game about mining gold. You are a miner of the world richest mining company, 
and your job is to control a super high tech mining machine. It is very power, 
that all the gold next to its hook will sticke to its surface due to the strong magnatic field. 
But high tech stuff is usually vulnerable, and this machine is no exception. 
If it touches any other obstacles, it will break. Of course, you will be responsible if that happens. 
But don't worry, the only punishment is death! So try to mine as much gold as possible before you meet the inevitable death! 
Remember! your family is always in our hand! 


## Esthetics:
The graphics style of this game will be similar to the original gold miner, which is cartoonish. The sound will be 8-bit, and mostly effect sound(like grabing the gold or bump in to a bomb). 

## Gameplay:

### Mechanics:
The basic mechanic will be controlling a hook while it rising to the surface. 
Player needs to adjust the path of that hook, so it can collect gold on the path while not hitting any obstacles. 
There will be multiple levels, and the next level option is only going to show up when player gathers enough gold. 
As the player advances, both the length of the level and required gold amount for next level will increase. 

### Control:
For desktop, player will use mouse to control the hook movement. The game keeps track of mouse location, 
and updates hook position accordingly.
It will be pretty much the same for mobile user, except it’s control with a touch screen.

### Teaching the game/New user experience aka "Onboarding":
There will be a short tutorial level that demonstrates the basic control of this game. 
Some instructions will show up on the sidebar in the tutorial level. 

### Player learning:
The control is simple, so it should be clear from the tutorial level. It’s mostly testing player’s reaction speed. 
However, there will be powerup that player can buy after completing each level.
* Life up (extra health)
* Hook Range upgrade (easier to grab the gold)
* Rocket boost (skip the beginning of next level)
